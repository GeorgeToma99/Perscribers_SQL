# Prescribers Analysis## IntroductionThe Prescribers Analysis is a fun data exploration project using the Medicare Part D Prescriber Public Use database. The aim here is to sharpen SQL skills (specifically PostgreSQL) by working with tasks like selecting, filtering, grouping, and joining data from over multiple different tables.## Technologies- PGAdmin 4- SQL (PostgreSQL)## Features- SQL scripts, including some bonus exercises to stretch your skills## Scope- Uncover relationships between prescribers, their claim numbers, specialties, and commonly prescribed drugs. While the data covers the entire U.S., most of the focus is on the Nashville, TN area.## Project Status- Finished## SourcesAlong with the database, this project uses the Part D Prescriber Methodology PDF for definitions and clarifications of key terms in the tables, and an ERD to show how the tables connect.## Additional InfoThis project was part of an apprenticeship with Nashville Software School. While guidance was provided through questions and tutorials, the queries and approach were crafted independently. You can check out the original questions and README in the questions folder above.
